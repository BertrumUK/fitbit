# fitbit
Code change to clear Server Code 500 when authenticating
Thanks to yusijs for writing the fix as posted here - https://github.com/home-assistant/core/issues/49285#issuecomment-823889803


To use these files create a folder called "fitbit" in the "custom_components" section of Home Assistant and add the 3 files listed. Restart Home Assistant and go through the authentication process again. An authentication file should download and the integration should start working.
